Hi FreeCodeCamp Family 

I'm from South Africa and i have been curious about learning to code for so long, that i researched and looked at numerous videos on where the best place to start is.
where i ended up is more confused and completely intimidated. 
I saw a Quincy Larson interview recently by chance on Youtube, he mentioned learning to code while doing work at the same time for non profit organizations, my mind got made up right then and there. 
i will try and for sure fail but i will fail trying to do something great for a good cause. and if i so happen to succeed then it will be a great Win for all.

Thanks 
Lou
